@article{Anderson1984,
abstract = {A novel Monte Carlo procedure is applied to the study of the kinetics of grain growth in two dimensions. The model employed maps the microstructure onto a discrete lattice. Each lattice site is assigned a number, between 1 and Q, which indicates the local crystallographic orientation. The initial distribution of orientations is chosen at random and the system evolves so as to reduce the number of nearest neighbor pairs of unlike crystallographic orientation. The temporal evolution of the microstructure is monitored to yield the time dependence of the size and shapes of the grains. The microstructures produced are in good correspondence with experimental observations of soap bubbles, foams and cross-sections of isotropic metallurgical specimens. Examination of the temperature and lattice dependence of the kinetics shows the existence of a number of universal features. The model properly reproduces the kinetics of the Ising model in the limit that Q approaches 2. For large Q, power law kinetics [Rm(t) - Rm(0) = Bt] are observed with the growth exponent, m, is found to be independent of Q with a value of approximately 2.4. The deviation of the growth exponent from the mean field value of 2 is discussed in terms of the role of vertices. ?? 1984.},

@article{Srolovitz1984,
abstract = {A Monte Carlo computer simulation technique has been developed which models grain growth in the presence of a particle dispersion. The simulation allows for the monitoring of an evolving microstructure as a function of time. The model predicts normal grain growth, i.e. R ?? = Ctn, where R ?? is the average grain size and n is the grain growth exponent, followed by an abrupt transition to a pinned state. Both the exponent n and the grain size distribution are found to be in close agreement with that observed for grain growth in the absence of particles. The grain size distribution and kinetics are independent of particle concentration. The final average grain area and the time required for the microstructure to pin are both approximately proportional to the inverse of the particle concentration. The results are quantitatively accounted for in terms of a simple topological theory. ?? 1984.},

@article{Manohar1998,
abstract = {The Zener equation was first reported by C. S. Smith in 1948 and since then it has become an integral part of any theory which deals with recovery, recrystallization and grain growth in particle-containing materials. Several modifications to the original equation have been made over the past five decades to improve its applicability to more realistic situations. This paper summarises these modifications and discusses which modifications are reasonable and justifiable based on the analytical models and experimental evidence reported in the literature. Several examples of the applications of the equation are provided to describe annealing phenomena in a wide variety of materials. The paper also examines the impact of the equation in the field of materials science and engineering and suggests a direction for its future development.},

@article{Li1990,
abstract = {Practically all papers concerned with grain refinement based on pinning by particle dispersions have considered spherical particles. In this paper we relax this restriction and Zener pinning equations are developed for ellipsoidal particles of any shape, orientation and degree of coherency. Theoretical predictions are verified using soap-bubble model experiments. It is found that within well defined conditions of particle orientation, disk or needle-shaped particles may offer greater pinning resistance, or Zener drag to migrating boundaries than spherical ones. It is shown, however, that the pinning resistance of non-spherical particles is very sensitive to particle orientation, and that their use in alloys is best utilised in systems based on mono-orientation dispersions. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

@article{Roters2010,
abstract = {This article reviews continuum-based variational formulations for describing the elastic-plastic deformation of anisotropic heterogeneous crystalline matter. These approaches, commonly referred to as crystal plasticity finite-element models, are important both for basic microstructure-based mechanical predictions as well as for engineering design and performance simulations involving anisotropic media. Besides the discussion of the constitutive laws, kinematics, homogenization schemes and multiscale approaches behind these methods, we also present some examples, including, in particular, comparisons of the predictions with experiments. The applications stem from such diverse fields as orientation stability, microbeam bending, single-crystal and bicrystal deformation, nanoindentation, recrystallization, multiphase steel (TRIP) deformation, and damage prediction for the microscopic and mesoscopic scales and multiscale predictions of rolling textures, cup drawing, Lankfort (r) values and stamping simulations for the macroscopic scale. {\textcopyright} 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.},
