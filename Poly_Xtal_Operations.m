% Abstract: In the computer age where artificial intelligence offered solution is taking precidence 
% over mathematical closed form solutions to real world problems due to its applicability to problems having
% a multitude of control parameters, it is therefore imperative to be used to predictmechanical behaviour 
% of structures as a function of crystallographic texture and grain structure. To do so, multiple instances of grain structure 
% and crystallograohic texture is needed which should be weakly coupled. In this work, we detail the capabilities of 
% Poly-Xtal Operations, a free and open source library in MATLAB is detailed. It works with MTEX for texture calculations
% and crystallographic grain structure characterization. Poly-Xtal Operations come with common grain morphology analysis tools. 
% It provides tools to calculate spatial gradients in grain structure with anisotropic grain morphology. Voronoi grain 
% structures can also be generated. Besides being able to export such 'grain structure - texture' instances to 
% further CPFEM analysis in ABAQUS, 'Poly-Xtal operations' stands out at being an independent tool for grain growth 
% analysis on square, triangular and hexagonal lattices using importance sampling Monte-Carlo schemes like Ising model,
% q-state Pott's model, 

% This paper outlines the data structure, input parameters and output capabilities.
